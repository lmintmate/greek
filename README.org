#+title: Yet another emacs keymap for polytonic Greek

I’m used to writing Greek with the modern Greek layout. This is quite different from any of the greek layouts offered with emacs in a way jarring to me. I found soon that someone had already made a package for what I wanted ; a layout that would provide polytonic Greek while also keeping the regular keyboard layout I was used to ([[https://web.archive.org/web/20190524095118/http://myria.math.aegean.gr/~atsol/emacs-unicode/][here]]).\\
However, as of the end of January 2020, this site was suddenly inaccessible, which meant that I had to keep my existing copies of these files, or I wouldn't be able to find them again. I thus created this repository, in order to keep a backup of these files.\\
Characteristics of this layout:
- One can get oxeia and vareia by using ; and ` respectively + a vowel e.g. ; + a = ά, ` + a = ὰ
- One can get perispomeni by using ~ + a vowel e.g. ~ + a = ᾶ
- One can get pneumata (daseia and psili) by using < and > respectively + a letter e.g. < + a = ἁ, > + a = ἀ
- One cat get dialytika by using : + a vowel e.g. : + i = ϊ
- Combinations of the above can be created by inputting the accents first (pneumata or dialytika, then tonoi) and then the letter e.g. < + ; + a = ἅ, : + ; + i = ΐ
